# Trivia-Game

### Purpose

This game was made mainly to practice some JavaScript and jQuery,
but also to make a cool trivia game.

### Features to Add:
A basic todo list of things I can keep adding to see what I need to do to make my site better.
Organized into big tasks (high & low priority) and smaller tasks (high & low priority)

## Big Rocks
  ** High Priority **
      1. create a landing page, user selects a button that then begins the game
      2. create a button that allows the user to move to next question after answer
  ** Lower Priority **
      1. randomize the order in which the questions come in
      2. Keep track of more specific data on user
        .. * what questions the user got wrong
        .. * how long it took for them to answer
        .. * load user data from localStorage?


## Small Rocks
** High Priority **
  1. Style the footer & include some Google Fonts
** Lower Priority **
  1. find some nice colors to use
  2. find some funny Gifs to use & include them
  3. Include some sound?
